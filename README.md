What is Image Classification?
Image Classification is the task of assigning an input image, one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has a large variety of practical applications.

Letâ€™s take an example to better understand. When we perform image classification our system will receive an image as input, for example, a Cat. Now the system will be aware of a set of categories and its goal is to assign a category to the image.

This problem might seem simple or easy but it is a very hard problem for the computer to solve. As you might know, the computer sees a grid of numbers and not the image of a cat as how we see it. Images are 3-dimensional arrays of integers from 0 to 255, of size Width x Height x 3. The 3 represents the three color channels Red, Green, Blue.
